Welcome to Tic-Tac-Toe!

A game played taking your turn marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O. 
The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner: you canâ€™t place a token on a square thatâ€™s already taken.

Please, in placing your move consider a board with squares identified as follows:

   1 | 2 | 3
  ---+---+---
   4 | 5 | 6
  ---+---+---
   7 | 8 | 9
